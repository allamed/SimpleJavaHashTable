# Simple Java Hash Table

This repository contains a basic implementation of a hash table in Java. The hash table is a widely-used data structure that allows for efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions of key-value pairs. This particular implementation uses chaining to resolve collisions, meaning that each location in the hash table contains a linked list of entries with the same hash key.

## Features

- Simple and easy-to-understand code
- Chaining for collision resolution
- Basic operations: insert, search, and delete

## Usage

The `HashTable` class contains methods for inserting, searching, and deleting key-value pairs in the hash table. To use the class, first compile the `HashTable.java` file:
javac HashTable.java

Then, run the compiled `HashTable.class` file:

java HashTable

This will execute the sample code provided in the `main` method, which demonstrates how to insert, search, and delete items in the hash table.

## Limitations

Please note that this implementation is designed for educational purposes and does not cover advanced features that one might expect from a hash table, such as dynamic resizing and load management. However, it serves as a solid foundation for understanding key concepts of hash tables and can be extended to meet specific needs.
