# Simple Java Symbol Table

This repository contains a basic implementation of a symbol table for lexical analysis in Java. The symbol table is a widely-used data structure in compilers and interpreters for storing information about identifiers such as variables and functions. This particular implementation uses a hash table with chaining for collision resolution.

## Features

- Simple and easy-to-understand code
- Chaining for collision resolution
- Basic operations: insert and search
- Customizable for specific use cases


## Usage

The `SymbolTable` class contains methods for inserting and searching identifiers in the symbol table. To use the class, first compile the `SymbolTable.java` file:
javac SymbolTable.java

Then, run the compiled `HashTable.class` file:

java SymbolTable

This will execute the sample code provided in the `main` method, which demonstrates how to insert, search, and delete items in the hash table.

## Limitations

Please note that this implementation is designed for educational purposes and may not cover all features that one might expect from a symbol table in a real-world compiler or interpreter. However, it serves as a solid foundation for understanding key concepts of symbol tables and can be extended to meet specific needs.
